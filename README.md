# Pick and Place Challenge(MEAM520-Final-Project)

We will perform the practical task of picking up objects in the environment and placing them where they need to go. We developed a robust and reliable solution which can acquire blocks (either stationary or in motion) and stack them on a goal platform, in as tall a tower as possible. The specific instructions is introduced in 'Competition Instruction'.<br>
